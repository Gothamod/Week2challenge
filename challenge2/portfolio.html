<img class="self" src="me.jpg">
<p>Hi I'm Paul L Smith, (I like letting people guess what my middle name, gives me insight into their mindset.) I was
    my dads caretaker for over twenty years, after his passing in twenty twenty I had to reevaluate my life path and so I 
    moved from my home state of Utah and took up a job working for Winco as a lumper in Boise Idaho. It was a late night fourteen hour job, honestly really sucked.
    Three months later I took the chance to chnage my job and worked for the Nampa Idaho Amazon Fulfillment Center, I worked for them for nine months before my sister (a single mother)
    told me that my newphew was havign a hard time coping with my fathers death and with my moving out and so I turned in my notice and pakced up what little I had
    and moved back to Utah to be closer to my family. Long story short I decided to pick up codeing as a way to stay close ot my family and Ideally I would like to
    work form home so I can help out both my widowed mother and single mother sister with day to day stuff. As much as I can. But I'm not only content to do this as
    a job I am also aming to be a writer. I have a overactive imagination and come up with ideas on a daily basis, some sound good others are stright up like what the-
    And writing seams to be the best way of using that part of mind instead of just letting it shrivle up and die.
</p>
